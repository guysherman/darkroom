# Darkroom

A new open-source photography tool with the following goals:
* Cross-platform
* Non-destructive
* GPU-based
* Extensible / Programmable for power users
* Nice collection of "presets" for the non-techies out there

## Current Status

Brand new, pretty much nothing to see here. Only builds on linux right now.

## Building

### Linux

Get the deps:
* Python
* GLEW
* GLFW
* cpp-check

Clone the source, then:

```
./waf configure
./waf
```

To run:

```
./build/darkroom
```
